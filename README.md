### Preliminary proposal 
My preliminary proposal was the question: 
from which time does internet stop being referred to as "the internet" in the available literature.
The hypothesis was to find the timeshift of the dropping of the word "the" in front of internet and that that shift would illustrate the integration of internet in general society. 
The methodology I would use is the Google tool Ngram viewer and also specific tekst analysis in command line.
